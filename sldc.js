// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "This is the second step where we assess what is needed in order to create the software."
const design = "This is the blueprint or rough draft in how the software is created."
const implementation = "The fourth step in which we start building the software and adding material."
const testing = "In this step we run the software and troubleshoot"
const maintain = "the final step where we make sure our code continues to work and make improvements along the way."
